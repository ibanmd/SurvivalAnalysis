# Problem 2.5
A model for lifetimes, with a bathtub-shaped hazard rate, is the exponential power distribution with survival function $S(x)=exp(1-exp((\lambda x)^\alpha))$.  
a) If $\alpha = 0.5$, show that the hazard rate has a bathtub shape and find the time at which the hazard rate changes from decreasing to increasing.  
b) If $\alpha = 2$, show that the hazard rate of $x$ is monotone increasing.

## Answer
First we find the hazard function:

\begin{align*}
h(x)
&= \frac{-S'(x)}{S(x)} \\
&= \frac{exp(1-exp((\lambda x)^\alpha)) * e^{(\lambda x)^{\alpha}} \lambda ^ \alpha \alpha x^{\alpha - 1}}{exp(1-exp((\lambda x)^\alpha))} \\
&= \alpha \lambda^{\alpha} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{(\lambda x)^{\alpha}}
\end{align*}

and 

\begin{align*}
h'(x)
&= \alpha \lambda^{\alpha} \left[(\alpha - 1)x^{\alpha - 2} exp((\lambda x)^{\alpha}) +
   x^{\alpha-1} exp((\lambda x)^{\alpha}) \alpha (\lambda x)^{\alpha - 1} \lambda  \right] \\
&= \alpha \lambda^{\alpha} exp((\lambda x)^{\alpha}) \left[(\alpha - 1)x^{\alpha - 2}
   + x^{\alpha-1} \alpha (\lambda x)^{\alpha - 1} \lambda   \right]
\end{align*}

It's worth noting that in this distribution, $\lambda>0$ is the scale parameter, $\alpha>0$ is the shape parameter, and the support is $x>0$.

**a)** Let $\alpha = 0.5$.  Then:

\begin{align*}
h(x)
&= .......... 
\end{align*}

**b)** Let $\alpha = 2$.  Then:

\begin{align*}
h'(x)
&= 2 \lambda^2 e^{(\lambda x)^2} \left[ 1 + x(2)(\lambda x) \lambda  \right]
\end{align*}

Since $x>0$ and $\lambda > 0$, it is easy to see that the derivative is always positive since the only operations are addition and multiplication of postive terms.  Thus, the hazard rate of $x$ is monotone increasing.

# Problem 2.8
The battery life of an internal pacemaker, in years, follows a Pareto distribution with $\theta = 4$ and $\lambda = 5$.   
a) What is the probability the battery will survive for at least 10 years?   
b) What is the mean time to battery failure?  
c) If the battery is scheduled to be replaced at the time $t_0$, at which 99% of all batteries have yet to fail (that is, at $t_0$ so that $P(X>t_0)=0.99$), find $t_0$.   

## Answer
The pdf of the Pareto distribution is 
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{\theta \lambda^{\theta}}{x^{\theta+1}}   &\mbox{for } x \ge \lambda \\ 
0                                              &\mbox{otherwise }  
\end{cases}
$$
and with $\theta = 4$ and $\lambda = 5$
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{2500}{x^5}   &\mbox{for } x \ge 5 \\ 
0                  &\mbox{otherwise }  
\end{cases}
$$

**a)** The probability that the battery will last for at least 10 years is
\begin{align*}
P(X \ge 10)
&= \int_{10}^{\infty} \frac{2500}{x^5} dx \\[1ex]
&= \left[ \frac{-625}{x^4}\right]^{\infty}_{10} \\[1ex]
&= 0+\frac{625}{10000} \\[1ex]
&= 0.0625 \\[1ex]
&= 6.25\%
\end{align*}
There is a 6.25% chance that the battery lasts longer than 10 years.   

**b)** The mean time to battery failure is
\begin{align*}
E(X)
&= \int_{5}^{\infty} x \frac{2500}{x^5} dx \\[1ex]
&= \int_{5}^{\infty} \frac{2500}{x^4} dx \\[1ex]
&= \left[ \frac{2500}{(-3)x^3}\right]^{\infty}_{5} \\[1ex]
&= 0 + \frac{2500}{(3)(125)} \\[1ex]
&= \frac{20}{3} \\[1ex]
&\approx 6.667
\end{align*}
The mean time to battery failure is $\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.667$ years.


**c)** In order to find $t_0$ such that $P(X>t_0)=0.99$, we solve the equation:
$$
\int_5^{t_0} \frac{2500}{x^5} dx = 0.01
$$
for $t_0$. Then doing so, 
\begin{align*}
\int_5^{t_0} \frac{2500}{x^5} dx  &= 0.01  \\[1ex]
\left[ \frac{-625}{x^4}\right]^{t_0}_{5}  &=  0.01  \\[1ex]
1 - \frac{625}{t_0^4}&= 0.01 \\[1ex]
\frac{625}{0.99} &= t_0^4 \\[1ex]
t_0 &\approx 5.012579 
\end{align*}
So, $t_0 \approx 5.01$ years, or 5 years and roughly 4 days.


# Problem 2.10
In some applications, a third parameter, called a guarantee time, is included in the models discussed in this chapter.  This parameter $G$ is the smallest time at which a failure could occur.  The survival function of the three-parameter Weibull distribution is given by
$$
S(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
1                               &\mbox{if } x < G \\ 
exp(-\lambda(x-G)^{\alpha})    &\mbox{if } x \ge G 
\end{cases}
$$
a) Find the hazard rate and the density function of the three-parameter Weibull distribution.  
b) Suppose that the survival time $X$ follows a three-parameter Weibull distribution with $\alpha=1$, $\lambda=0.0075$ and $G=100$.  Find the mean and median lifetimes.   

## Answer

**a)**  

**b)** With those values, the survival function is then
$$
S(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
1                       &\mbox{if } x < 100 \\ 
e^{(-0.0075(x-100))}    &\mbox{if } x \ge 100 
\end{cases}
$$

## Answer


# Problem 2.18
Given a covariate $Z$, suppose that the log survival time $Y$ follows a linear model with a logistic error distribution, that is
$$
Y = ln(X) = \mu + \beta Z + \sigma W
$$
where the pdf of $W$ is given by
$$
f(w) = \frac{e^w}{(1+e^w)^2}, \;\; -\infty < w < \infty
$$

a) For an individual with covariate Z, find the conditional survival function of the survival time $X$, given $Z$, namely, $S(x|Z)$.  
b) The odds that an individual will die prior to time $x$ is expressed by $\frac{1-S(x|Z)}{S(x|Z)}$.  Compute the odds of death prior to time $x$ for this model.     
c) Consider two individuals with different covariate values.  Show that, for any time $x$, the ratio of their odds of deaths is independent of $x$.  The log logistic regression model is the only model with this property.
