Using R to recreate an example from class...

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(KMsurv)
library(survival)
```

The data set is in the KMsurv package, below are the first 12 lines of the data set:

```{r}
# Load data from KMsurv package
data(larynx)
attach(larynx)

# Print first few rows
kable(head(larynx, 12))
```

Now we need to fit a Cox PH model with a single covariate, age.

```{r}
cox_model <- coxph(Surv(time = time, event = delta) ~ age); summary(cox_model)
```

As in class, the coefficient for age is 0.023.  

***log-likelihood (partial) = -195.906 ?***  

Full model:

```{r}
cox_model2 <- coxph(Surv(time = time, event = delta) ~ as.factor(stage) + age) 
summary(cox_model2)
```
